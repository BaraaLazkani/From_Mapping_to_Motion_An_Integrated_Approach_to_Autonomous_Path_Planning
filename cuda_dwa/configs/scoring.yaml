# Scoring Configuration for CUDA DWA
# Defines trajectory evaluation weights and scoring function

scoring:
  # Trajectory Scoring Weights
  # These weights determine which trajectories are preferred
  # Total weight should sum to 1.0 for interpretability

  speed_weight: 0.3      # Weight for forward velocity component (30%)
                         # Higher → prefers faster trajectories
                         # Formula: (velocity / max_speed) * speed_weight

  heading_weight: 0.7    # Weight for goal-directed motion (70%)
                         # Higher → prefers trajectories toward goal
                         # Formula: (1 - distance_to_goal / max_distance) * heading_weight

  # Scoring Function Breakdown:
  # score = speed_component + heading_component
  #       = (v / v_max) * 0.3 + (1 - dist/100) * 0.7
  #
  # Where:
  # - v: trajectory velocity
  # - v_max: maximum velocity (from robot.yaml)
  # - dist: final distance to goal after simulation
  # - 100: normalization factor (approximate max expected distance)
  #
  # Collision Handling:
  # - If trajectory collides with obstacle → score = -∞ (rejected)

  # Alternative Scoring Components (Future Extensions):
  # obstacle_clearance_weight: 0.1  # Prefer trajectories far from obstacles
  # smoothness_weight: 0.05         # Prefer smooth velocity changes
