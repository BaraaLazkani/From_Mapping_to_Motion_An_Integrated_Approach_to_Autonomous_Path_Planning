# Environment Configuration for CUDA DWA
# Defines occupancy grid map parameters and goal position

environment:
  # Occupancy Grid Map
  map:
    width: 1024           # Map width in cells (pixels)
    height: 1024          # Map height in cells (pixels)
    resolution: 0.1       # Meters per cell (0.1m = 10cm per pixel)

    # Map size in meters:
    # - Width: 1024 * 0.1 = 102.4 meters
    # - Height: 1024 * 0.1 = 102.4 meters

    # Obstacle Generation (for testing/simulation)
    obstacle_density: 0.05  # Fraction of cells with obstacles (5%)

  # Goal Position
  goal:
    x: 90.0  # Goal X position (meters)
    y: 90.0  # Goal Y position (meters)
