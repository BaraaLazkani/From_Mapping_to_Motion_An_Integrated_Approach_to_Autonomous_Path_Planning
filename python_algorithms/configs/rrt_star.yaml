# RRT* (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star) Algorithm Configuration
# RRT* is a sampling-based planner with asymptotic optimality

algorithm:
  name: "rrt_star"

  parameters:
    # Sampling parameters
    step_size: 0.5              # Maximum edge length for extending tree
    max_iterations: 500         # Maximum number of samples to generate
    goal_sample_rate: 0.2       # Probability of sampling goal (0.0-1.0)

    # RRT* specific parameters
    rewire_radius: 2.0          # Radius for searching neighbors to rewire
    goal_tolerance: 1.0         # Distance threshold to consider goal reached

    # Random seed for reproducibility
    # Set to null for random seed, or specify an integer for deterministic behavior
    random_seed: null
